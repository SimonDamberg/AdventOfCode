# Advent Of Code 2021

My take at the Advent Of Code 2021 coding challenge! I have never coded in GoLang so I thought I would use this a learning exercise. The assignments are located in the README-files in the corresponding directory.

## Update

When coming back to these challenges, I have decided to use python instead since I want to focus on the algortihmic aspects of the challenges, not learning a new language.
